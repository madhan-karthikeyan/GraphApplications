## Project Overview

This application is built to demonstrate the implementation of various graph algorithms and data structures in C. The main functionality includes creating a graph, adding edges with weights, performing BFS and DFS traversals, finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, and detecting cycles in the graph.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: Uses an adjacency list to store vertices and edges.
- **Graph Algorithms**:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** traversal
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** traversal
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for finding the shortest path
  - **Cycle Detection** for checking if the graph contains a cycle
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Allows users to perform various operations on the graph.
